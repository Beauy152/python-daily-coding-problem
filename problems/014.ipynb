    "For this problem, i was unfamilair with the category of `Monte Carlo Methods`, though it's simple enough to assume roughly based on the name. After doing some initial research into the problem (given i was unfamiliar), it became quite clear as to the approach to take. Overall this problem was quite simple to implement once i understood the theory of the problem."
