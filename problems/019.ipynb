    "* Houses are a fixed cost. It costs X amount to build any given house.\n",
    "* As no cost was provided for colours, assume they are abitrary -\n",
    "* This problem seems flawed, as there is no indication that the houses MUST be of K different colours, meaning that by simply alternating between colours A & B this problem could be solved assuming A & B are the two cheapest paints.\n",
    "* If the rules were to use all colours, then we would need a limitation that N >= K, so that each colour could be used at least once.\n"
